Now MS Excel and MUMPS database work togethe

MX technology introduction : 
  - All information is kept not in the Excel books, but on the server in the form of multidimensional cubes and virtual Excel sheets
  - When user connects to the server, his real Excel sheet fills with data from required virtual sheet. Sheets are closely interrelated â€“ changes are displayed on both sheets
  - After disconnection, the real Excel sheet is not being saved, however data still remains on the server
  - Control and data processing are performed by special formulas (commands of MUMPS)  in the cells of the sheets 
  
  (MUMPS is an acronym for the Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System, also known as M)
